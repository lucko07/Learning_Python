# These are very important notes or commands to remember: 


# ✔ [] is used for indexing or accessing dictionary keys.
# Example:
# person["name"]
# person["job"]

# ✔ () is used for function calls
# Example:
# print("hello")
# type(person)
# len(fruits)

# 🧠 Simple memory trick:
# [] = get something from something
# (lists, dictionaries, strings)

# () = call something
# (functions)

"""
✅ Quick rule to remember

If the line starts with >>> → you are inside Python, you write Python code only.

If the line starts with PS C:\...> → you are in PowerShell/terminal, you run commands like:

python file.py

git status

pip install ...
"""


# ✅ Correct Rule (Simple & Accurate)
"""
✔ List → uses square brackets []
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

✔ Tuple → uses parentheses ()
person = ("Luckner", 27, "Miami")

🧠This is the standard syntax in Python:

Lists = mutable (changeable)

Tuples = immutable (unchangeable)
