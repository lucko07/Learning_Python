# let’s begin DAY 3.
"""
Today is an important day because you will learn the tools used in all logic, all automation, all AI scripts, trading bots, decision-making algorithms, and data processing.

By the end of Day 3, you will be able to:

control the flow of your program

make decisions

loop through lists

repeat actions

build simple logic engines

prepare for real machine learning and UI projects
"""

# COMPARISON & LOGICAL OPERATORS (very important!)

"""
This section is critical because comparison and logical operators are used in:

trading bot conditions

AI model thresholds

cybersecurity detection rules

data filtering

decision engines

and almost all if/else logic.
